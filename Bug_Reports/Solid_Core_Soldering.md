# Bug Report
Report made June 24 2024.
So at the beginning of this month, I was trying to assemble a basic testing rig.
During the assembly I soldered some xt-60 connectors to the solid core awg 14 wire.
But the connections kept breaking after soldering. I thought it might be soldering incorrectly. (and that might partially be the case)
However, I was able to get connectors and wires that temporarily had a connection which would soon after break.
I suspect that these were breaking because the solder was more fragile than the solid core was malleable.
This suspicion is supported by my ability to solder the wires between the motor controller and the motor into a solid connection.
